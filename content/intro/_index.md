In this technical introduction to the Ark, we will outline one by one
the basic concepts that make up the Ark protocol.

On the [homepage](/), you can find a high-level overview of the functionality
and interactions, but in here we will try to go a little more in-depth on the
technical details of how these concepts actually work.

A quick outline of the different aspects, as also outlined in the side menu:

- [What are VTXOs?](vtxos)
- [How do Ark rounds work?](rounds)
- [How do Connectors work?](connectors)
- [Out-of-Round payments](oor)
